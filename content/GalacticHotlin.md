## Galactic

The universe is about 46 Billion and a bit light years in width. There's 70 Sextillion stars estimated to be out there, burning up and giving way entropy. Most of these have their own set of planets. It's a scale that defies human comprehension. In such a mind-wrecking expanse that people take it as a guarantee of some other life out there. We can't be the sole product of a ancient explosion. Maybe there is other beings out their who looked up into the expanse and grasped it, we could only be decades away from joining the club.

Or maybe we're just alone. This is it. 

The thought that someone else is out there is comforting, someone in the same boat feeling the same as you. The thing is we don't know how lifeforms form, or even the chances of it. How can we say there is life out there if we have no real idea on how it starts, what conditions are needed. This process is called abiogenesis, and all we have is theories about it. We’ve developed tests and large experiments but there have been minimal conclusive and verifiable studies about this. Our planet sample size is also 1.

Statistically, yes, there could be a lot of opportunity for life, we know there are an insane number of planets that exist with a lot of crossover with earth. But. It is entirely plausible that the chances of abiogenesis, or life forming from scratch, is so small that even with a septillion opportunities the chances could remain too low to guarantee, especially if it's already happened once.

So if we lack a solid idea on how life starts  we have to be able to accept that in this universe it may be just us. No ‘Wow' signals, no new friends, no utopias with all the answers and no second chances.

**We’re it, all alone on our little blue ball.**

## Local

Loneliness is a strange topic. We have this great existential loneliness that we face as a species that is rarely express though, it’s not a looming constant in their minds. You don’t have hotlines for galactic loneliness. 

What we do have it for is interpersonal loneliness. Which in a time of COVID and widespread isolation has become a secondary pandemic. Engulfing those who don't normally have the best of times, and giving those who do a shock through the stark change

Outside of the pandemic, it remains a virus, unable to be controlled by most people. It infects them and attacks their condition. Breeding doubt and fear of becoming a burden. Every reach to send a friend a text feeling like a fruitless and exhausting journey. Why would you mention it or bring it up. 

Over time distraction begins to replace the friends. It’s easier. You work or play or eat because it keeps your mind busy. It works and you feel good until you pick up your phone and realize it’s been weeks since you text that friend, or called the other. And the worst part, they never tried reach out either. Even if you wanted to make the move there’s a distance now. 

You feel out of the loop, you don’t get that meme they’ve shared. “Who did they tag in that? I don know them…” - “maybe they’ve moved on to other people. Better People.”

You put the phone down and return to your distraction, being let down by every notification, thinking it's a text when really it's the lotto app or that game you never deleted.
You know you've been forgotten about. It was your fault, you never reached out and it's time to accept that. You can accept that your social life is through stories now, it's not FOMO if you never had a chance of going right? 

## End

This local, personal loneliness is far more dangerous because there is FOMO, you did have a chance and people could text or reach out. If you believe the galactic loneliness there is no chance, there is no FOMO, there is no text. It's easy to accept. But no matter how hard you try, people will always hope for a friend to pull through and that hope, and the inevitable repeated crushing of it is the stark difference.
